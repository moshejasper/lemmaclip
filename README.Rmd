# lemmaclip

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lemmaclip is to efficiently clip and paste Greek vocab lemmas for use in Logos Software. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of lemmaclip from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("moshejasper/lemmaclip")
```

## Example

Here is how you NT vocab at the 19-20 level:

```{r example}
library(lemmaclip)
## basic example code
lemmaclip(19, 20)
```

And here is how you clip all vocab at a frequency of 20 or above

```{r}
lemmaclip(20)
```


I hope you enjoy!!!
